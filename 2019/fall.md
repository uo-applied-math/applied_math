# Applied Mathematics I: Computation and combinatorics

This is a *draft syllabus*, subject to change.

**Goals:** Proficiency with advanced methods for computation and algorithms, with a focus on tools from graph theory, statistical mechanics, and optimization. Students completing this course should  be able to implement and analyze efficient algorithms in python, have a sophisticated mathematical understanding of uses and descriptive statistics of graphs (often known as "networks" in other fields), including random graphs, and have a good familiarity with some exactly solvable statistical mechanical models (which will set the stage for the third course in this series).

**Topics:** Recursive and dynamic programming, enumerative combinatorics, algorithmic complexity, graph theory and the graph Laplacian(s), random graphs, random spanning trees, the dimer model, the Ising model, topics in optimization.

## Prerequisites:

Experience with programming similar to an undergraduate course (preferably in python). Familiarity with probability, random variables, and linear algebra at an undergraduate level.


## Course structure

Three hours of lecture (including computer demonstration and chalkboard exposition), and 1.5-2 hours of computer lab (in a classroom, mostly consisting of pair programming on student laptops) per week.

## Homework and assessment

Weekly homeworks will consist of a mix of pen-and-paper problems and computational exercises. Computational homework will be turned in as jupyter notebooks, allowing integration of programming, simulation results, and LaTeX into a single document.  There will be a final exam, which will be taken in-class, on paper - we will assess understanding of computational methods by asking for written descriptions of algorithms (for instance).


## Software

* A recent version of [Python](https://python.org)
* A working installation of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* The python package [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* A good code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io)

## Books

We will not follow a single text, but students who would like additional reading might find these useful:
    
* Bollobas, Modern Graph Theory nicely covers the graph theory topics we will cover (and more).

## Inclusion and accessibility

Please tell us your preferred pronouns and/or name,
especially if it differs from the class roster.
We take seriously our responsibility to create inclusive learning environments.
Please notify us if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in barriers to your participation! You are also encouraged
to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155
or uoaec@uoregon.edu.

We are committed to making our classroom an inclusive and respectful learning space.
Being respectful includes using preferred pronouns for your classmates.
Your classmates come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences;
please avoid assumptions or stereotypes, and aim for inclusivity.
Let us know if there are classroom dynamics that impede your (or someone elseâ€™s) full engagement. 

Please see [this page](../pages/policies.html) for more information on
campus resources, academic integrity, discrimination, and harassment (and reporting of it).
