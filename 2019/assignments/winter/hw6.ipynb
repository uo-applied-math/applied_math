    "1. Simulate this process, by picking a small $dt$ and doing small steps that approximate the above equation:\n",
    "   $$ X(t + dt) - X(t) = - c X(t) dt + W, $$\n",
    "   where $W$ is random (what distribution should $W$ have?).\n",

    "2. It turns out that $X(t)$ can be defined directly in terms of white noise as follows:\n",
    "   $$ X(t) = e^{-ct} X(0) + \\int_0^t e^{-c(t-s)} dB(s) .$$\n",
    "   Show that if we define $X(t)$ in this way, then the increment, $X(t+dt) - X(t)$, has the mean and variance\n",
    "   implied by the equation above for small $dt$. (The mean and variance of the increment\n",
    "   should be computed with $X(t)$ *given*, e.g., $\\mathbb{E}[X(t+dt)-X(t)|X(t)]$.\n",
    "   To do this, write $X(t+dt)$ as a sum of two terms: one which is a deterministic function of $X(t)$\n",
    "   and one which is *independent* of $X(t)$.)\n",
