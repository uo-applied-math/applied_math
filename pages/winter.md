# Applied Mathematics II: Statistical Learning


**Description**: 
This course will cover statistical and machine learning theory using foundational approaches (i.e. not neural-network based, as these will be the focus of the third course in the Applied Math sequence). These will include probability theory, regression, classification, kernel methods, mixture models and expectation maximization, as well as inference for sequential data using hidden Markov models and linear dynamical systems. Homework assignments will be a mix of pen-and-paper calculations together with implementations and applications of machine learning algorithms to real and synthetic data using Python. The main prerequisites for this course are calculus and linear algebra. Prior familiarity with probability and statistics or with coding will be helpful but is not necessary.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with probability and random variables at an undergraduate level, experience with python programming, linear algebra. Completion of the first course in this sequence will be sufficient.

## Schedule overview:

The course will follow *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*, by Bishop.

Tentative list of topics:

- Linear predictors (Ch. 3)
- Classification (Ch. 4)
- Kernel methods (Ch. 6)
- Mixture models and the EM algorithm (Ch. 9)
- Sequential data (Ch. 13)

Additional possible topics (if time permits):

- Support vector machines (Ch. 7)
- Approximate inference (Ch. 10)
- Sampling methods (Ch. 11)
- Continuous latent variables (Ch. 12)



## Homework and assessment:

Weekly homeworks will consist of a mix of pen-and-paper problems and computational exercises. Computational homework will be turned in as jupyter notebooks, allowing integration of programming, simulation results, and LaTeX into a single document.  There will be a midterm and a final exam, which will be taken in-class, on paper - we will assess understanding of computational methods by asking for written descriptions of algorithms (for instance).
Grades will be assigned based on either 40% homework + 30% midterm + 30% final, or 20% homework + 40% midterm + 40% final, whichever is larger.

## Software

* A recent version of [Python](https://python.org)
* A working installation of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* A good code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io)

## Books

We will not follow a single text, but students who would like additional reading might find these useful:

* Gardiner, Stochastic Methods: A Handbook for the Natural and Social Sciences has useful descriptions of many stochastic processes we will cover, from a physical point of view.
* Bass, Stochastic Processes takes a more formal approach.


## Inclusion and accessibility

Please tell us your preferred pronouns and/or name,
especially if it differs from the class roster.
We take seriously our responsibility to create inclusive learning environments.
Please notify us if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in barriers to your participation! You are also encouraged
