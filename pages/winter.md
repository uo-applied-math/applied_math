# Applied Mathematics II: Stochastic processes and dynamical systems

This is a *draft syllabus*, subject to change.

**Goals**: Deep understanding of the tools underlying data analysis and predictive mechanistic modeling: proficiency with properties of common stochastic processes and linear dynamical systems, their uses in modeling and computation, and ability to simulate and visualize these. Students completing this course should be familiar with the mathematical basis of common stochastic models, explain assumptions underlying these models, identify plausible uses and misuses in real life, and know how to calculate (mathematically and computationally) important quantities. Examples and applications will be drawn from biology and data science.

**Topics:** Markov chains, Brownian motion, Gaussian processes, point processes, diffusions and associated PDE, random matrices, linear systems theory.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with probability and random variables at an undergraduate level, experience with python programming, linear algebra. Completion of the first course in this sequence will be sufficient.

## Schedule overview:

* Weeks 1-2: Poisson point processes
* Weeks 3-4: Markov chains, stochastic processes, and generators
* Week 5: Brownian motion and Gaussian processes
* Week 6: The stochastic integral
* Weeks 7-8: Diffusions and associated PDE (via the Fokker-Planck equation)
* Weeks 9-10: Linear systems theory


## Homework and assessment:

Weekly homeworks will consist of a mix of pen-and-paper problems and computational exercises. Computational homework will be turned in as jupyter notebooks, allowing integration of programming, simulation results, and LaTeX into a single document.  There will be a midterm and a final exam, which will be taken in-class, on paper - we will assess understanding of computational methods by asking for written descriptions of algorithms (for instance).
Grades will be assigned based on either 40% homework + 30% midterm + 30% final, or 20% homework + 40% midterm + 40% final, whichever is larger.

## Software

* A recent version of [Python](https://python.org)
* A working installation of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* A good code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io)

## Books

We will not follow a single text, but students who would like additional reading might find these useful:

* Gardiner, Stochastic Methods: A Handbook for the Natural and Social Sciences has useful descriptions of many stochastic processes we will cover, from a physical point of view.
* Bass, Stochastic Processes takes a more formal approach.


## Inclusion and accessibility

Please tell us your preferred pronouns and/or name,
especially if it differs from the class roster.
We take seriously our responsibility to create inclusive learning environments.
Please notify us if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in barriers to your participation! You are also encouraged
to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155
or uoaec@uoregon.edu.

We are committed to making our classroom an inclusive and respectful learning space.
Being respectful includes using preferred pronouns for your classmates.
Your classmates come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences;
please avoid assumptions or stereotypes, and aim for inclusivity.
Let us know if there are classroom dynamics that impede your (or someone else’s) full engagement.
